# Nut & Bolt Assembly (SolidWorks)


## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a parametric 3D model of a standard nut and bolt assembly designed using *SolidWorks*. The project demonstrates fundamental fastener design principles, thread modeling techniques, and assembly constraints in mechanical engineering applications. 

This precise mechanical assembly serves as both an educational resource for understanding fastener mechanics and a practical example of parametric CAD modeling. The design features a hexagonal head bolt with precision threading and a corresponding hexagonal nut, showcasing proper mechanical engagement between components.

## 🛠️ Software & Tools
